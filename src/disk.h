// does not leave that alone: whenever it rescans such a disk it rewrites the
// partition table to match the device. Most of that rewrite is what "sgdisk -e"
// would do and is welcome, but it also recomputes the primary header's
// PartitionEntryLBA as FirstUsableLBA minus the length of the entry array,
// rather than leaving it pointing at the entry array, which has not moved. On
// the ordinary layout -- FirstUsableLBA 34, a 32-sector array at LBA 2 -- the
// wrong formula arrives at the right answer and nothing breaks. On an image
// that reserves space ahead of its first partition, as ARM board images do, it
// points at empty space and the primary table is corrupt.
